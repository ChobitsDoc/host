			<h2>Bitcoin Limited Option Pricing</h2>
			<p>The value of a Bitcoin Limited Call (Put) Option is the value of a traditional European call (put) option whose strike price is the Bitcoin Limited Call (Put) Option's strike price, minus the value of a traditional European call (put) option whose strike price is the Bitcoin Limited Option's full profit price. Think of option spread strategy, pricing of Bitcoin Limited Option is very similar to it. This page guides to estimate the theoretical price of a Bitcoin Limited Option, and this is not an investment advice, you should not make investment decisions based upon values generated by it. <strong>Finally, even you make a deal at the price far from the theoretical price, you still have a good chance to win, because that's a feature of options. <strong></p>

				<h3>STEP 1: Volatility</h3>
				<p>First, we need to know the annual volatility of bitcoin. The easiest way is to check it on internet, for example, <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/">https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/</a> or <a href="https://bitvol.info/">https://bitvol.info/</a> . After you get the volatility, turn it into annualized form. If the volatility you have is 30 days, multiply it by the square root of 12 (because one year has 12 30 days), if the volatility you have is weekly, multiply it by the square root of 52 (because one year has 52 weeks) and so on. </p>
				<p>EXPLANATION: Volatility is expressed as a percentage of the underlying price, indicating a one standard deviation move over the course of a year, <a href="https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/what-is-volatility/">click here for more on volatility</a>. Actually we need the volatility in terms of bitcoin, because Bitcoin Limited Option is an inverse option, so you probably need to convert the volatility in USD to volatility in bitcoin if you need a more precise price. However, if the absolute value of the volatility is not so big (which applies to most cases), their outcomes are quite close, and this conversion is not needed. <p>

				<h3>STEP 2: Use a Calculator</h3>
				<p>After obtaining the annualized bitcoin volatility, we need to calculate two European Options' price to get the price of a Bitcoin Limited Option. Pricing for traditional European options is mature, you can find some option price calculators available on internet (usually based on Black-Scholes model), for example, <a href="http://option-price.com/">http://option-price.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.cboe.com/trading-tools/calculators">http://www.cboe.com/trading-tools/calculators</a> . Fill out the form with the strike price (in terms of bitcoin, as shown in the image) of the Bitcoin Limited Option to get the first option price, and then fill out the form with the full profit price (in terms of bitcoin) of the Bitcoin Limited Option to get the second option price. The difference of the two is the Bitcoin Limited Option's theoretical price. </p>
				<p>EXPLANATION: You can <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/">click here for more on option pricing</a>. Usually the no-risk interest rate of bitcoin is required, and because there is not a bank operates with bitcoin and tells you what the interest rate is, you might use a estimated value here. </p>
